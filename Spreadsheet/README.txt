A short summary of the Spreadsheet GUI features:
On running the application, you see 4 things above the grid. An enter filename entry, a cell name label, a value label, and a contents entry.
Enter a filename in the name entry for saving to a file (which will be explained later on.
Next, select any cell and you find that you can enter contents in the cell that is selected. Depending on what the contents are, (string, number, formula) the value will update accordingly.
If the cell is invalid, notice that a display popup error will occur. We have three extra buttons, a set button and sum row/column buttons. The set button just is a way to manually
click setting a button contents and value. The sum column and row buttons are used by selecting a cell, and then clicking the buttons, to get the sum of the whole row or the whole column to be the contents and value of the cell that is selected
in the row and column it is in.
If you open the menu bar on the top left of the spreadsheet, we see that it allows us to open a .sprd file in our directory to a spreadsheet in the GUI.
We can also just make a new spreadsheet by selecting new that will erase the current displayed spreadsheet. We can also save a spreadsheet in the application as a .sprd file in the documents folder in
the system directory.
If you need help managing the spreadsheet, there is a help page in the menu bar Help > spreadsheet help. There is an explanation on how to mangage the spreadsheet.
